# Image Processing workshop with OIT university
## Project : Chopstick Holding Gesture Correction
### Description
  This project use a mediapipe and opencv to perform an image processing, specfically  to recognize hand gesture. We use a variety of build-in module provided by OIT university to perform hand gesture recognition and line detection.
  Together we design a UI and algorithm to process data from a detection algorithm to recognize which gesture is a proper way to hold a chopstick. 

#### Example of the application
- hand detection <br>

- The yellow lines are virtual chopstick I create to guide a user. It also serve as a reference to determine whether the user is hold the chopstick properly or not. <br>
